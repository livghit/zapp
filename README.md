# ZAPP - Zero-Trust Autonomous Packet Protector 🌐🛡️

> **Effortless network monitoring, real-time security alerts, and device tracking – all in one lightweight, drop-in tool.**

---

## 🚀 What is ZAPP?

**ZAPP (Zero-Trust Autonomous Packet Protector)** is a self-hosted, lightweight network monitoring tool that provides real-time insights into all connected devices on a network. It helps detect unauthorized access, alerts users about unsafe devices, and visualizes network activity.

With ZAPP, you can:
✅ Discover all devices on your network automatically.  
✅ Get **instant alerts** when unknown devices connect.  
✅ Monitor **real-time network traffic & bandwidth usage**.  
✅ Detect **open ports & potential vulnerabilities**.  
✅ Generate **historical logs & security reports**.  
✅ Stay protected with **intrusion detection & unsafe device warnings**.  

No complex setup. No bloated software. Just drop it on any machine and start monitoring! ⚡

## ⚠️ Work in Progress 🚧
ZAPP is currently under active development. Features may evolve as we refine the project. Contributions are welcome – let’s build the ultimate open-source network monitor together! 💙

## ✨ Features

### 🔥 **Core Features (Essential)**
✅ **Device Discovery** → Automatically detects all devices connected to the network.  
✅ **Unknown Device Alerts** → Instantly notify users when an unauthorized device joins.  
✅ **Live Network Map** → Visualizes all connected devices and their activity.  
✅ **Intrusion Detection** → Identifies suspicious activity and potential threats.  
✅ **Open Port Scanning** → Detects exposed ports that could be security risks.  
✅ **Traffic Monitoring** → Displays real-time network traffic and bandwidth usage.  
✅ **Unsafe Device Detection** → Flags devices with outdated firmware, weak passwords, or vulnerabilities.  
✅ **Historical Logs & Reports** → Stores device connection history for security auditing.  

### ⚡ **Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)**
🔹 **DNS Monitoring** → Detects suspicious domain requests from devices.  
🔹 **Bandwidth Throttling Alerts** → Identifies devices consuming excessive bandwidth.  
🔹 **Geolocation Tracking** → Provides an approximate location of network devices.  
🔹 **Web Dashboard** → A clean UI for remote monitoring & control.  
🔹 **Automated Security Checks** → Scans for weak passwords, outdated firmware, and vulnerabilities.  
🔹 **Dark Mode** → Because dark mode makes everything cooler. 😎
